<!-- # 🔐 Secure Authentication System with Brute Force Protection

A production-ready authentication system built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB with advanced security features like JWT authentication, account lockout, rate limiting, and email alerts for suspicious activity.

---

## 🚀 Key Highlights

* 🔐 JWT-based authentication system
* 🛡️ Brute-force attack protection (account lockout)
* ⏱️ Rate limiting to prevent abuse
* 🔒 Secure password hashing using bcrypt
* 📧 Email alerts on suspicious login attempts
* 🧠 Login attempt tracking & logging

---

## 💡 Why This Project?

This project demonstrates real-world cybersecurity practices used in modern backend systems to protect user accounts from unauthorized access and attacks.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User registers → password is hashed using bcrypt
2. User logs in → credentials verified
3. JWT token is generated for authentication
4. Failed login attempts are tracked
5. After 5 failed attempts → account is locked
6. Email alert is sent to user
7. Protected routes require valid JWT token

---

## 🛡️ Security Features

* 🔒 Password hashing (bcrypt)
* 🚫 Brute-force protection (account lock system)
* ⏳ Rate limiting (prevents spam attacks)
* 🔑 JWT authentication
* 📧 Email alerts for suspicious activity
* 🔐 Environment variable protection (.env)

<!-- # 🔐 Secure Authentication System with Risk-Based Security & Geo Tracking

A production-ready authentication system built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB with advanced security features like JWT authentication, brute-force protection, geo-location tracking, and intelligent risk-based login detection.

---

## 🚀 Key Highlights

* 🔐 JWT-based authentication (Access + Refresh Tokens)
* 🛡️ Brute-force protection (account lockout)
* ⏱️ Rate limiting to prevent abuse
* 🔒 Secure password hashing using bcrypt
* 📧 Email alerts for suspicious login attempts
* 🌍 Geo-location tracking (IP → Country & Region)
* 📱 Multi-device session management
* 🧠 Risk-based login detection
* ✈️ Impossible travel detection (🔥 advanced feature)

---

## 💡 Why This Project?

This project demonstrates **real-world cybersecurity practices** used in modern backend systems, including behavior-based authentication similar to systems used by Google and other large platforms.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User registers → password is securely hashed
2. User logs in → credentials verified
3. System captures:
   - IP address
   - Device (user-agent)
   - Geo-location
4. Risk score is calculated based on:
   - New device
   - New IP
   - Country change
   - Impossible travel
5. If risk is high:
   - Email alert is triggered
6. Session is stored with location & device details
7. JWT token is issued for authentication

---

## 🛡️ Security Features

* 🔒 Password hashing (bcrypt)
* 🚫 Brute-force protection (account lock system)
* ⏳ Rate limiting (prevents spam attacks)
* 🔑 JWT authentication (Access + Refresh tokens)
* 📧 Email alerts for suspicious activity
